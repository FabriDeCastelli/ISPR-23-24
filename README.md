# ISPR-23-24
Intelligent Systems for Pattern Recognition 2023/2024 course repository.

This repository contains all solutions of the assignments that I chose to solve throughout the course:
- [Assignment 1](/assignment1): Time series analysis on the Air Pollution Dataset
- [Assignment 2](/assignment2): Restricted Boltzmann Machines implementation from scratch, tested on MNIST
- [Assignment 3](/assignment3): Denoising and Contractive Autoencoders implementation from scratch, digit generation test on MNIST
- [Assignment 4](/assignment4): 8 slides presentation of [Masked Autoregressive Flow for Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07057) - George Papamakarios, Theo Pavlakou, Iain Murray

The complete and detailed notes of the course can be downloaded in the [Notes23-24.pdf](/Notes23-24.pdf) file, written in collaboration with [Francesco Aliprand](https://github.com/francealip), list of topics:
